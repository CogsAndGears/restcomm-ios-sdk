# Restcomm Olympus Demo App

This is the original version of the Demo App kept inside Xcode regular project. Notice the sources hosted here are also used by the pod version of the App at ../restcomm-olympus. The reason we keep 2 separate projects with same source files, is to make it easier to build any flavor, since at times we need both of them
