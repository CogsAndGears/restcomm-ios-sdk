# Restcomm iOS SDK Demo Apps

We provide 2 Demo Apps to show case the Restcoomm iOS SDK:

1. restcomm-helloworld: a pretty basic single view Demo App to get you started
2. restcomm-olympus: a more complex Demo App with multiple views, contacts, settings, etc

Notice that for the Olympus Demo App, we have 2 separate projects. One based on CocoaPods and one independent, both of which point to the same set of source files. The reason we keep 2 separate projects with same source files, is to make it easier to build any flavor, since at times and for debugging/testing purposes we might need both of them
