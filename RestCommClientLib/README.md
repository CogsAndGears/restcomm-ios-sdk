# RestCommClientLib

This is the original version of the SDK's library kept inside Xcode a regular Xcode library project (as opposed to CocoaPods pod). Notice the sources aren't hosted in this directory, but pulled via a symbolic link from ../RestcommClient (i.e. pod library project), so that we can maintain both side by side without source code duplication
